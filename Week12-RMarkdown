# Creating a Shiny App for my hireLetter package
## Step 1: Create the UI
The options the hiring individual can modify are age, experience, and role by setting a minimum required for them. The main panel of the shiny app will display the pass and failed applicant tables and is expected to show the letter templates soon.

```{r ui}
ui <- fluidPage(
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      sliderInput(inputId = "age",
              label = "Minimum Age:",
              min = 1, max = 100, 
              value = 20),
      sliderInput(inputId = "experience",
              label = "Minimum Experience:",
              min = 1, max = 100,
              value = 2),
      selectInput(inputId = "role",
              label = "Applying Position:",
              choices = c("Civil Engineer", "Project Manager", "Professor", "Chef"),
              selected = "Project Manager")),
  mainPanel(
    div("Candidates that Passed"),
    tableOutput("Pass"),
    div("Candidates that Failed"),
    tableOutput("Fail"),
    textOutput("AcceptL"),
    textOutput("RejectedL")
    
  )
  
)
)

```

## Develop the server code
The output table is the first part of this shiny function that works. The integration of the output table to create the output letter is still a work in progress. I still need to find a way to reference these tables in a for loop to create and display the letters possibly in a new tab.

```{r shinyfunction}
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$Pass <- renderTable({
    datafilter <- data %>% filter(age >= input$age & experience >= input$experience & role == input$role)
    })
    
  output$Fail <- renderTable({
    datafilter <- data %>% filter(age < input$age | experience < input$experience | role != input$role)
})
# Need to find a way to reference output$Pass table in order to make letter template
    output$AcceptL <- renderText({
    for(j in output$pass){
    paste("Dear", data$name, ",\n")
    paste("We are pleased to offer you a posiiton as a", data$role, "!")
    }
  
  })
} 

# Repeat for rejected applicants

# Sample Data to input
name <- c("Josephine", "Carl", "John")
age <- c(23,45,78)
experience <- c(1,5,6)
role <- c("Project Manager", "Civil Engineer", "Chef")
data <- data.frame(name, age, experience, role)

```

# Print the shiny app for user 
```{r print}
# Need to make shiny app into function usuable in package hireLetter
shinyApp(ui=ui, server = server)
```
