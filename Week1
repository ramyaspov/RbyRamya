# Week 2 Assignment
# Author: Ramya Subramanian

assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
myMean <- function(assignment2){return(sum(assignment2)/length(assignment2))}
myMean(assignment2)

#The function called myMean finds the mean of the values stored in the variable assignment2. 
#This is done using the sum function (adding values) 
#and length function (adding the number of values)
#Then the function divides the two to find the mean producing the output 19.25
